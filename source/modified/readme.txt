This is where "What the Dickens" keeps its copies of the modified texts of Dickens' books.

(It modifies them by stripping out Project Gutenburg headers and footers and inserting placeholders where it finds character names).


[These started off as being created by ..\index.py, but have now had contents, prefaces and other front matter manually stripped off.]
